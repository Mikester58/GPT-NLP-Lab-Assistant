      "content": "Ohm's Law states that there is a linear relationship between voltage and current in a resistor. It describes how much voltage will be dropped across a resistor when a certain amount of current flows through it.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nV = I \u00d7 R\n\nWhere V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance.\n\nThis law applies to all devices that impede the flow of current, including resistors."
