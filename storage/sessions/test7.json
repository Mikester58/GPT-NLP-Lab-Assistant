      "content": "Based on the evidence provided, the direct answer to the question \"What is Ohm's Law?\" is:\n\nOhm's Law describes a linear relationship between the current and voltage in a resistor. It states that small resistance \u2192 larger currents, small voltage drop \u2192 smaller currents, and large resistance \u2192 smaller voltages.\n\nThis can be summarized as: V = I/R (Voltage drop across a resistor is proportional to the current flow through it)."
