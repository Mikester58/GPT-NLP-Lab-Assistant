      "content": "Ohm's Law states that the voltage drop across a resistor is proportional to the current flowing through it, and inversely proportional to the resistance of the resistor. It can be expressed mathematically as:\n\nV = IR (Voltage drop equals current times resistance)\n\nWhere:\nV = Voltage\nI = Current\nR = Resistance"
