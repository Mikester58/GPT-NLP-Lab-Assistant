      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow the given evidence step by step.\n\nGiven:\n- Source voltage (V) = 12 V\n- Resistance of the first resistor (R1) = 2 k\u03a9 = 2000 \u03a9\n- Resistance of the second resistor (R2) = 5 k\u03a9 = 5000 \u03a9\n\nStep 1: Find the current through each resistor in steady-state.\nUsing Ohm's Law, I = V/R:\n- For R1: I1 = 12/2000 = 0.006 A\n- For R2: I2 = 12/5000 = 0.0024 A\n\nStep 2: Find the voltage across each resistor in steady-state.\nUsing Ohm's Law, V = IR:\n- For R1: V1 = 0.006*2000 = 12 V\n- For R2: V2 = 0.0024*5000 = 12 V\n\nStep 3: Find the total current (I) in steady-state.\nUsing Ohm's Law, I = V/R:\n- I = 12/2000 + 12/5000 = 6 A\n\nStep 4: Find the voltage drop across each resistor.\nSince the source is in series with both resistors, we can find the total voltage drop (Vd) and then subtract it from the source voltage to find the voltage drop across each resistor:\n- Vd = V - I*R\n- For R1: Vd1 = 12 - 6*2000 = 12 - 12000 = -11988 V\n- For R2: Vd2 = 12 - 6*5000 = 12 - 30000 = -29888 V\n\nTherefore, the total current is 6 A, and the voltage drop across each resistor is 11988 V or -29888 V."
