      "content": "Ohm's Law describes a linear relationship between current and voltage in a resistor.\n\nV = I*R\nWhere V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. This means that as the voltage increases, the current will increase proportionally, and vice versa, assuming the resistance remains constant."
