circuit, 𝜔𝑜 = 2𝜋 rad/sec, 𝜔𝑐 = 2𝜋 rad/sec. 
 
If a periodic signal 𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡) is input to our first order filter, the output can be determined by 
representing the input as a sum of sinusoids and then calling on the concept of superposition to 
determine the output.  If the input is written as 
𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡) = ∑ 𝑉𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑘𝜔𝑜𝑡)∞
