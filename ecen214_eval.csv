"Explain how to convert a time domain cosine signal into its phasor representation.","A(t) = Am cos(w t + phi) is represented in the phasor domain as A = (Am / 2) angle phi. The phasor keeps only magnitude and phase while omitting the time dependence."
"Given a 12 V peak sinusoidal source at frequency w, write the phasor representation.","A 12 V peak cosine source has a phasor magnitude of 6 V. With zero phase shift, its phasor is 6 angle 0 degrees."
"Describe the steps to compute impedance of a resistor and capacitor in series.","The total impedance is Z = R + 1/(j w C). The resistor contributes a real term R and the capacitor contributes a negative imaginary term 1/(w C)."
"Describe the steps to compute impedance of a resistor and inductor in parallel.","Compute the reciprocal: 1/Z = 1/R + 1/(j w L). Combine the terms, then invert to obtain Z. The inductor contributes a positive imaginary term j w L in the denominator."
"How does increasing frequency affect the impedance of a capacitor?","Capacitive reactance decreases as frequency increases. As w rises, 1/(w C) becomes smaller, so the capacitor behaves more like a short circuit at high frequency."
"How does increasing frequency affect the impedance of an inductor?","Inductive reactance increases with frequency. As w increases, w L grows, so the inductor behaves more like an open circuit at high frequency."
"Explain why current leads voltage in a capacitor under sinusoidal steady state.","For a capacitor, i = C dv/dt. Differentiation shifts the current waveform ahead of the voltage by 90 degrees, so the current leads the voltage."
"Explain why current lags voltage in an inductor under sinusoidal steady state.","For an inductor, v = L di/dt. Differentiation causes voltage to peak earlier, resulting in current lagging voltage by 90 degrees."
"Explain how to compute the magnitude and phase of a complex number in rectangular form.","For a complex value a + j b, the magnitude is sqrt(a^2 + b^2), and the phase is arctan(b / a)."
"Describe the condition required for steady state AC analysis to be valid.","All transient components must decay so that voltages and currents become purely sinusoidal at a single constant frequency."
"Explain how to measure phase difference between two signals using an oscilloscope.","Measure the time shift between matching points such as peaks. The phase shift is 360 degrees times the time shift divided by the signal period."
"Describe the effect of incorrectly connecting oscilloscope grounds in AC measurements.","Incorrect grounding can short circuit nodes, distort the waveform, or cause incorrect amplitude readings due to unintended current paths."
"Why is calibration required before performing impedance measurements in lab equipment?","Calibration removes systematic errors such as cable inductance and stray capacitance so the instrument reports accurate impedance magnitude and phase."
"Compute the average power given Vrms, Irms, and phase difference.","Average power is P = Vrms * Irms * cos(theta). It represents the real power delivered to the load."
"What is the difference between real power and reactive power?","Real power represents energy that is actually consumed, while reactive power represents energy exchanged between inductors and capacitors without being consumed."
"Explain the purpose of RMS values in AC circuit analysis.","RMS values provide the DC equivalent heating effect of a sinusoidal signal and allow power calculations using P = Vrms * Irms * cos(theta)."
"Describe how a voltage divider works in AC circuits using impedance.","In the phasor domain, Vout = Vin * Z2 / (Z1 + Z2). Each impedance contributes according to its complex value, affecting both magnitude and phase."
"Explain resonance in an RLC series circuit.","Resonance occurs when the inductive reactance w L equals the capacitive reactance 1/(w C). At this point they cancel, leaving only the resistance."
"Explain how Kirchhoff laws apply to phasor circuits.","KVL and KCL apply directly using phasor voltages and currents, with sums performed using complex arithmetic."
"How can grounding issues in the function generator lead to incorrect AC measurements?","Shared grounds or ground loops can create unintended return paths, causing signal distortion, changes in amplitude, or shifts in measured phase."
