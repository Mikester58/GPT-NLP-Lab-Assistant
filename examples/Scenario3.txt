## Preparing for Lab Practical Exam ##

Overview:
An instructor assigns students a lab practical exam where they must independently configure an op-amp circuit. A student decides to practice using Temlog before the exam.
Steps:
The student approaches Temlog and says:
“Hey Temlog, can you quiz me on setting up an inverting amplifier circuit?”
Temlog replies:
“Sure. Step 1: Where should you connect the input signal? Step 2: Which pin must be connected to ground? Step 3: How do you calculate the gain from resistor values?”
The student answers each step. Temlog provides corrective feedback:
“Correct the input signal goes to the inverting input through the resistor. The non-inverting input should be grounded. Remember, the gain is -Rf/Rin.”
The student then uploads a photo of their breadboard setup. Temlog analyzes it and responds:
“Good placement. However, the feedback resistor should connect directly between the op-amp’s output and inverting input. Adjust that for stability.”
After making the correction, the student confirms understanding. Temlog saves the interaction under “Op-Amp Exam Practice” for later review.
