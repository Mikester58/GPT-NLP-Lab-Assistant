## Assisting with Research Lab Documentation and Data Review ##

Overview:
A graduate researcher in an electrical engineering research lab is preparing a weekly update for their advisor. They need to summarize lab notes, retrieve previous troubleshooting steps, and verify part of a circuit configuration using documentation.
Steps:
The researcher walks up to Temlog and says:
“Hey Temlog, can you pull up last Tuesday’s circuit setup for the inverter tests?”


Temlog checks the timestamped database logs and responds via speech and screen:
“Found a file from Tuesday labeled ‘Inverter_Setup_Scan_09-09.pdf’. Displaying it now.”
The document is shown on the screen.


The researcher replies:
“What values were used for the gate resistor and the load capacitance?”


Temlog reads the PDF and says:
“Gate resistor: 220Ω. Load capacitance: 100nF. These were noted in the test config block on page 2.”


The researcher follows up:
“Summarize the three main issues reported that day.”


Temlog responds:
“1. Gate ringing above 6V due to probe grounding.
 2. MOSFET temperature exceeded the safe limit after 15 minutes.
 3. Signal distortion in output waveform under high load.”


The researcher says:
“Thanks, can you save this session as ‘Advisor Summary’?”


Temlog saves the transcript to the cloud and confirms:
“Session logged and titled ‘Advisor Summary.’ You can access it anytime from your account.”
