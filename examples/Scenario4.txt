## Checking Component Values Before Use ##

Overview:
A first-year student in an Intro to Circuits lab needs to confirm the value of a resistor before inserting it into their breadboard. They are unsure how to read the color bands.
Steps:
The student says:
“Hey Temlog, what value is this resistor?”
The student holds the resistor up to Temlog’s camera. Temlog uses its vision system and responds:
“This resistor has bands brown, black, orange, and gold — that corresponds to 10kΩ with ±5% tolerance.”
The student replies:
“Thanks, that’s what I needed.”
The session is logged under “Component Identification.”
